This is a quick and dirty script I wrote to help my mom prepare her google classroom after she mentioned that she does the same tedious steps to get everything setup everyday. The code itself is honestly pretty bad, but I wanted to get it to her fast and also it works. I'm versioning it here so it will make it easier for her to pull and update if she wants me to change anything about it.
